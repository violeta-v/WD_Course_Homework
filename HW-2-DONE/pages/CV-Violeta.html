<hr>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b> Digital & Ecommerce Executive | Digital Designer – Nkuku</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">March 2019 – now</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I started at Nkuku as a Digital & Ecommerce Executive, but over time as the team grew, my role <br> changed to Digital Designer. At the beginning my tasks revolved around: all digital campaign assets development, email design, <br> social and 
paid social media assets production, display ads, web merchandising for both of Nkuku websites: trade and retail and print <br>
design of POS materials for the company’s store. I am also entirely responsible for all the images we receive from <br>
photoshoots, I prepare them for upload and make sure they are all nicely balanced and proportional when viewed on a <br>
listing page. My retouching experience comes in handy, as even though already retouched, many of the images need extra 
work.</p>
<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b> Email Marketing Designer – Pro Direct</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">November 2018 – March 2019
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">As an email marketing designer, I worked closely with the in-house graphic designers and <br> producers to ensure designs were created in-line with all other ongoing marketing campaigns. The designs were achieved in Photoshop and <br> then built and sent through Dotdigital. Together with the email manager, we would A/B test different design strategies in order to identify <br> the most effective approaches and visuals. </p>
<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b> Ecommerce Retoucher – Pro Direct</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">March 2018 – November 2018
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">My previous position at Pro Direct involved retouching digital photographic images on a daily basis <br> and uploading the edited assets on the company’s website. I would work closely with the ecommerce and creative photographers in order to <br> achieve a result in line with the company’s brand guidelines. </p>
<br>


<h3 style="text-align: center;"><b> Marketing Coordinator – Varitech Systems</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">September 2016 – March 2018
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">My position at Varitech Systems involved working closely with the sales team in order to develop and <br> implement marketing and advertising campaigns and to create all promotional materials, including tradeshow stands and POS supporting <br>  graphics. I ensured that social media and the company website were up-to-date, as well as visually cataloguing all products, producing <br> a series of product-led promotional and instructional videos and the development of all other physical media and graphics. </p>
